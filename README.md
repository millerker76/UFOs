## Overview of the Project:
My colleague, Dana, has created a UFO Sightings webpage that allows users to view a table of UFO sightings and filter them by date.   At her request I’ve added additional search functionality so that users can also filter the sightings by city, state, country and shape.  Now the users can even more easily search for and display just the sightings that they’re most interested in.

## Try out the multi-criteria search filter
<b> Follow these steps to practice using the search filters:</b> 

1.  Enter a state (try <b> ca </b> for California) and notice that the table to the right is now filter to only display sightings in California.  (figure a)
2.  Experiment with further filtering the results by entering <b> el cajon  </b>  to show only results for El Cajon, California.   (figure b)
3.  You can continue to further filter results by date, shape, etc. or start over with new criteria. (figure c)
4.


<b>Tip:</b> Use blue boxes (alert-info) for tips and notes. 

Deliverables
1. Retirement analysis:
retirement_titles.csv - this csv file lists all the employees who are currently eligible for retirement and their current job title.

retiring_tites.csv - this csv file shows the count of retirement eligible employees by job title.

% of employees retiring - the chart below shows the percentage of current P-H employees who are eligible to retire.

Pie chart

We can see that nearly a third of the current workforce are eligible to retire and that many, many positions will need to be filled. It will be important to consider providing incentives to retirement-eligible employees to remain with the company a little longer in order to mentor the new employees

2. Mentorship analysis:
mentorship_eligibility.csv - this csv file lists all the employees who are eligible for a mentorship program at P-H.

mentorship_titles.csv - this csv file shows the count per job title of employees who are eligible for mentorship

Summary
This analysis has delivered a list of retirement-eligible employees and a list of mentorship-eligible employees as well as tables showing the count of each per job title. An additional deliverable, the mentorship_titles table was produced to show the count of mentorship-eligible employees per job title.

In addition, the analysis has shown that nearly a third of current employees are eligible to retire and a wave of hiring will be needed to replace them. An additional table, the all_current_emps table was produced to help provide insight into number of all current employees in proportion to retirement eligible employees.

Although there is a huge population of retirement-eligible employees who can mentor existing newer employees, as they retire, P-H risks losing a lot of organizational knowledge and skill that takes years to develop.
